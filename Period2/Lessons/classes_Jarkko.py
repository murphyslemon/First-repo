recap on object oriented Programming
what is the role of a function?
class used to create a group of data or elements
class is a descrption
containing statement what kind data elements or variables and also functions
object holds different values
use class to create an object
one class can create multiple objects
initializer is a function that is called when u create a class __init__
initializer is sometimes called method or constructor
self is a variable name
self is the reference to the object
we need a way to separate for different objects
reference to our current object
init function called when creating an object
always the same function
how does function know which object its creating
self is the reference
CPU and memory connected together
all variables have addresses in memory
python will store variable in empty memory

what is a static variable
variable without self under a class definition
will be created when your program starts
example application is to know how many objects you have created
needs to be refered to by the class name with a .
no way to create more of a static variable
conversly objects from a class can be created as many as we want

dynamic memory allocation
dont know how many variables will be created
space for the variable is created only when u run the code
