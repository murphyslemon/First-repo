# Programming Exercises
This repository contains all my programming exercises required in my semester at Metropolia UAS. 
I created this repository in my first year of university because I wanted to learn how to use Git and GitHub. 
The exercises cover various topics and languages, including:

- Python
  - using relational databases
  - using external interfaces(API)
  - Setting up a backend service with an interface
- html
- javascript
- css
