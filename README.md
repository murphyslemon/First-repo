# Programming Exercises
This repository contains all my programming exercises required in my semester at Metropolia UAS. 
I created this repository in my first year of university because I wanted to learn how to use Git and GitHub. 
The exercises cover various topics and languages, including:

- Python
- html
- javascript
- css
