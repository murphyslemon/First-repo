#Write a program that asks the user to enter the ICAO codes of two airports.
# The program prints out the distance between the two airports in kilometers.
# The calculation is based on the airport coordinates fetched from the database.
# Calculate the distance using the geopy library: https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/.
# Install the library by selecting View / Tool Windows / Python Packages in your PyCharm IDE,
# write geopy into the search field and finish the installation.
